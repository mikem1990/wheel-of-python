# Wheel of Python ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-Python3-green)
A wheel of fortune like game built with python in a CLI and features practical use of JSON data. 
To begin select the number of human players and computer players in the game. Computer players feature a difficulty setting
based on the probability of guessing letters in the frequency they appear in the English language. 
The program then retrieves a random category and phrase from a JSON file and processes it to be obscured from players to begin guessing.
Players take turns spinning the wheel whose outcome is randomly retrieved from a JSON file and guessing letters in the phrase.
The player to complete the phrase wins!/
